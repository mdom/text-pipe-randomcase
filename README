NAME
    Text::Pipe::RandomCase - Text::Pipe filter to randomize character case

SYNOPSIS
       use Text::Pipe qw(PIPE);
       print PIPE('RandomCase')->filter('foobar');
       print PIPE('RandomCase', probability => 2 )->filter('foobar');

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a pipe segment for Text::Pipe to randomly uppercase
    the characters of a string. It takes one optional argument named
    *probatility*, which determines the frequency of upper case characters.
    Any 1/N'th character will be uppercased on average.

    If you do not pass any arguments, *filter()* will return strings with a
    probability of 1/4 for any character to be uppercased.
