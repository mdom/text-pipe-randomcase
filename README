NAME
    Text::Pipe::RandomCase - Text::Pipe filter to randomize character case

SYNOPSIS
       use Text::Pipe qw(PIPE);
       print PIPE('RandomCase')->filter('foobar');
       print PIPE('RandomCase', probability => 2 )->filter('foobar');

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a pipe segment for Text::Pipe to randomly uppercase
    the characters of a string. All of the described methods can also be
    used as paramters to its constructor.

METHODS
  probability($arg)
    Determines the frequency of upper case characters. Any 1/$arg'th
    character will be uppercased on average. Defaults to undef, in which
    case this module will return strings with a probability of 1/4 for any
    character to be uppercased.

  force_one($bool)
    If given a true value - in the Perl sense, i.e. anything except undef, 0
    or the empty string, any string will have at least one uppercased
    character in a random position. If no argument is given, it returns the
    slot's value. Default to false.

DEPENDENCIES
